Marhaba! I am ek(i)n and I write about philosophy, technology, web and other stuff that I am inspired by or curious about. On this blog, I would like to exchange some techno-social knowledge from:

- academic studies of Mechanical Engineering (B.Sc. TUM) as well as self-taught Software Engineering experience.
- academic studies of Philosophy of Science and Technology (M.A. TUM).
- daily observations of this astounding world we are living in
