This blog is going to be about Bitcoin, Lightning and everything that has to do with distributed && decentralized systems.
To be continued....

Marhaba! I am ek(i)n and I write about philosophy, technology, web and other stuff that I am inspired by or curious about. On this blog, I would like to exchange some techno-social knowledge from:

- academic studies of Mechanical Engineering as well as self-taught Software Engineering experience.
- academic studies of Philosophy of Science and Technology
- daily observations of this astounding world we are living in
